# MovieMaker
Linux command line digital image processing application. Animates an image file by hue rotation or saturation shift. This software can also reverse a a .yuv file.
I made this MovieMaker software in a freshman C class. It taught me about advanced pointer techniques. I also learned about digital image processing algorithms. Some of the algorithms I implementeed but were not included in the final animation application include edge detection, brightness changing, and mirroring.
