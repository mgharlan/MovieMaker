HW5:
This final project was pretty incredible. I can see how more complex data structures 
can be used as a very powerful tool and I really enjoyed making the double linked list.
 My reverse function handles the first entry first and then enters a loop to handle the
 other entries. The void previous pointer of the first entry was causing errors so I 
handled it out of the loop. The hue and saturation filters were not difficult to 
implement. The hardest part that I faced was seperating the heigth and width when the 
user inputs the size. I learned that when pointers all point to the same place, if 
you modify one they all get modified. I was able to implement all the pieces succefully.
 This MovieLab was one of the most fun labs!
